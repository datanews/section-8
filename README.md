'Regular' vouchers are traditional, mobile vouchers that move with a tenant. These are the 'Housing Choice Vouchers' we focused on in our analysis. 'Project Based Vouchers (PBV)' are connected to an affordable housing unit. 'Enhanced' vouchers are for households in buildings leaving an affordable housing program.

* `Long Term Suspensions & Transfers 04.21 v3.xlsx` has a list of census tracts that NYCHA Section 8 households moved from, and a list of census tracts they moved to after their units failed inspection in 2015.
